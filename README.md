I worked on cloning a trendy hypercasual project called "Pull With Mouth!," and I named my version "Hand Wrestle." I implemented the mechanics following the original developers' instructions. Check it out, play around with it, and feel free to share your comments and feedback. Here's the link to the main project: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arm-wrestler/id1624435011

How to Use:

Clone the repository.
Open the project in your preferred IDE.
Run the game and explore the features.
Feedback:
Feel free to leave comments or open issues for any feedback or suggestions.
